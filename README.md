# Automata

## Finite Automaton (Finite State Machine)
_Wikipedia: Finite automata are formal (or abstract) machines for recognizing patterns. These machines are used extensively in compilers and text editors, which must recognize patterns in the input._

Emerging artificial intelligence technologies including computer vision and personal identification algorithms raise questions about the ethics, legality, and potential for bias around their use in the public sphere. But, there are some great examples of how machines can contribute and make a positive impact in our lives as well. 

#### Pattern recognition and generation is ubiquitous in computing:
  
<table>
<tr>
  <td> 
  
    - patterns of symbols in a program
    - patterns of words in a document
    - patterns of characters in a file
    - patterns of bits in an image

  </td>
  <td> 

    - Initialization
    - Looking for "m"
    - Recognized "m", looking for "a"
    - Recognized "ma", looking for "i"
    - Recognized "mai", looking for "n"
    - Recognized "main"

### Automata and Formal languages are key concepts in theoretical computer science

Automata is a theoretical model of a machine that can read, process, and recognize input strings. There are several types of automata, including finite automata (FA), pushdown automata (PDA), and Turing machines. Finite automata are used to recognize regular languages, which are a subset of all formal languages. Pushdown automata are used to recognize context-free languages, which are a larger set of languages than regular languages. Turing machines are the most powerful type of automata and can recognize any language that can be computed by an algorithm.

Formal languages are sets of strings that can be recognized by different types of automata. A formal language is a set of strings over a given alphabet, which is a finite set of symbols. For example, the set of all strings of 0s and 1s is a formal language over the binary alphabet. Formal languages can be classified into different types based on the type of automaton that can recognize them, such as regular languages, context-free languages and context-sensitive languages.

In summary, Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and their computational power, while Formal languages is the study of sets of strings and the languages that can be defined from them, and how different types of automata can recognize and generate different types of languages.
